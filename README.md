## Introduction to Electrical Impedance Tomography<a name="intro"></a>

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a method imaging which uses surface measurements to determine variations in electrical conductivity, permittivity, and impedance within an object to image that specific object. It is highly used in medical imaging as it is noninvasive and biological tissues and fluids have considerable variations from each other in conductivity and is therefore distinguishiable using EIT. 


## Problem Description <a name="problem-description"></a>
In the regular set-up for an EIT system, surface electrodes are attached to the skin of the object being examined. Current is then applied to node pairs (located such that the examined area separates the two nodes) and the voltage across the nodes is measured such that conductivity can be measured.
